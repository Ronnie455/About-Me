# About-Me

ðŸŽ“ I graduated LEARN Academy Bootcamp on may 5th 2023 as a Full-Stack web developer.

I enjoy building Open Source Projects and enthusiastic about learning new languages. During my education at LEARN Academy, I learned Javascript, Ruby, Ruby on rails, CSS, HTML, testing with jest, react testing, and rspec.

Immediately following my graduation from LEARN, I interened with LEARN as well. During my time being an intern, I learned a lot of new skills. Such as Tailwind CSS, ESLint, Notion, CI pipline, Git action, scoping tickets, velocity change and so much more. I contributed to an open source decoupled application. I helped develop it using React and ruby on Rails. The purpose of this application is to track students work, absences, notifications etc. While the admin side can edit and new content to the website.

Before my transition into tech I joined the Army at 18, and spent my time as a ðŸª‚ Parachute infantryman. I left the service at the age of 22. After I got out I spent a couple of years working construction building inground pools, but I received the oppurtunity to become a Heavy Equipment operator as a Wildland fire fighter. After fire season I went back to construction, but decided I needed to change my life so I pursued education in tech.

In my free time I like to go fishing, ride dirtbikes, snowboard and learn more about tech.
