# About-Me

ðŸŽ“ I graduated LEARN Academy Bootcamp on may 5th 2023 as a Full-Stack web developer.

I enjoy building Open Source Projects and enthusiastic about learning new languages. During my education at LEARN Academy, I learned Javascript, Ruby, Ruby on rails, CSS, HTML, testing with jest, react testing, and rspec.

INTERNSHIP

Before my transition into tech I joined the Army at 18, and spent my time as a ðŸª‚ Parachute infantryman. I left the service at the age of 22. After I got out I spent a couple of years working construction building inground pools, but I received the oppurtunity to become a Heavy Equipment operator as a Wildland fire fighter. After fire season I went back to construction, but decided I needed to change my life so I pursued education in tech.

In my free time I like to go fishing, ride dirtbikes, snowboard and learn more about tech.
