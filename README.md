# About Me

## Education
ðŸŽ“ I graduated from LEARN Academy Bootcamp on May 5th, 2023, as a Full-Stack web developer.

I enjoy building Open Source Projects and am enthusiastic about learning new languages. During my education at LEARN Academy, I learned JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML, and testing with Jest, React Testing Library, and RSpec.

## Internship
Immediately following my graduation from LEARN, I interned with LEARN as well. During my time as an intern, I acquired a lot of new skills, such as Tailwind CSS, ESLint, Notion, CI pipeline, Git actions, scoping tickets, velocity change, and much more. I contributed to an open-source decoupled application, developing it using React and Ruby on Rails. The purpose of this application is to track students' work, absences, notifications, etc., while allowing the admin side to edit and add new content to the website.

## Background
Before transitioning into tech, I joined the Army at 18 and served as a Parachute Infantryman. I left the service at the age of 22. Afterward, I spent a couple of years working in construction, building inground pools. However, I received the opportunity to become a Heavy Equipment Operator as a Wildland firefighter. After the fire season, I returned to construction but decided I needed to change my life, so I pursued my passion and obtained an education in tech.

## Interests
In my free time, I enjoy fishing, riding dirt bikes, snowboarding, and learning more about tech.
